# Challenge-Sequelize

## Description

In this challenge we will be building basic ORM functionallity base on Sequelize using mysql2

--- 

## Main Goal

Implementing the next functions: 

* Insert ()

* BulkInsert ()

* FindAll ()

* FindOne ()

* FindByPk ()

* Update ()

* soft/hard Destroy ()

* Restore ()

---
 
## First Steps

1. Clone template repository

2. Run ``` $npm i ```

3. If you want to run the tests locally, connect to your MySql in the test connection statment, which is located in the ``` beforeAll() ``` in the main test. Enter you password and create empty DB called db_test in your machine.

## General

### Files and Folders:

## Use The Template!

* main class MySequelize in index.js, which located in the main folder

### Operations:
* folder called 'Op'. inside the folder you must have the file 'OpSymbols.js' (rest of the files is for your decision)

![Op folder](./ReadMePics/OpFolder.png)
* 'OpSymbols.js' should export the object 'Op', as in the picture

![Op export](./ReadMePics/OpExport.png)

* so we can require it as follow in the test 

![Op require](./ReadMePics/OpRequire.png)

* and use it this way (like in sequelize...)

![Op use](./ReadMePics/OpUse.png)


### Include:

* 'include' statment recieves the folowwing parameters:

![Include params](./ReadMePics/IncludeUse.png)

* 'include' statment should return nested array inside the original object, with key equel to the table name

* ```[TextRow] ``` is a playlist object

### Submiting The Challenge

1. The repository must be public and the solution must be in master/main branch

2. Copy the relative url of the repository and paste in the submiting form.
